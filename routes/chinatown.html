                    The Ann Siang Hill area is a quiet enclave amid the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. Meander through brightly coloured shophouses and gain insight into the lives of Singapore's early immigrants. Located beside the former Telok Ayer Bay, it was one of three hills (the others being Mt Wallich and Mt Erskine, which were eventually levelled) collectively known as Telok Ayer Hills.

                    In the early days of the settlement, clove and nutmeg plantations were established in many parts of the island, including the Ann Siang and Duxton Hill areas. Charles Scott was the first to plant these crops on Ann Siang Hill. Ann Siang Hill was superbly irrigated; an underground spring ran through the area and was tapped from a well on the hill.

                    After Scott left his plantation, it passed through the hands of another owner before being sold to Chia Ann Siang in 1894. From then on, the face of Ann Siang Hill changed forever. Shophouses sprang up; Chinese and Straits Chinese residents and businesses moved in and the area was transformed into an urban district.

                    In his 1822 Master Town Plan, Sir Stamford Raffles allocated the whole area west of the Singapore River for a Chinese settlement known as the Chinese Campong, envisaging that Chinese would form the bulk of future town dwellers. Singapore, the new land of opportunity then, had attracted many Chinese immigrants, who expanded the original boundaries of this economically and culturally vibrant, self-contained town. This self-contained <em>kampong</em> (community settlement) became home to many Chinese immigrants, and a transit point for coolies (unskilled labourers) going to Malaya.

                    The original <em>kampong</em> was divided into zones for each Chinese community of the same provincial origin and dialect group. The Cantonese occupied Temple Street. The Hokkiens were located in Telok Ayer Street and Hokkien Street, while the Teochews were settled in South Canal Road, Garden Street and Carpenter Street. Different trades were also confined to specific areas, so each street took on its own identity. From delicacies to death-houses, there were businessmen, traders, craftsmen, hawkers and peddlers to provide all of the peoples’ needs.

                    Pearl’s Hill is named after Captain James Pearl, commander of the Indiana, the ship which brought Raffles to Singapore in 1819. Pearl decided he wanted to take up residence in Singapore and eventually buy the hill from the Chinese. He owned the entire hill in 1822 and had a house built at the top to stay. As a tribute to Raffles, he called the hill Mount Stamford. However, when Raffles found out that Pearl had bought the hill without his approval, he directed that the hill should be repossessed. While Raffles eventually relented, the incident left Pearl with such a bad taste in his mouth that he decided to rename the hill after himself.

                    Pearl’s Hill City Park is a tranquil nature spot built around a service reservoir at the top. Built in 1904, the reservoir is similar to the one at Fort Canning Park. That’s not the only connection between the two hills. Once taller than Fort Canning Hill and obstructing the trajectory of the guns mounted, the top of Pearl’s Hill was "shaved off" in the 1861 to make Fort Canning Hill and its military fort the higher ground.

                    The People's Park Complex was completed in 1973 and was regarded as an emblem of Asian Modernism. The building featured Singapore's first atrium in a shopping centre, a concept pioneered by the Metabolist Movement of Japan in the 1960s. It was also the largest shopping complex in Singapore in the 1970s.

                    The Upper Barracks located on Pearl’s Hill is rich in history and bears reminders of Singapore’s turbulent post-war times and the operations carried out to maintain public order. Built at the same time as the Lower Barracks, the strategic location of the buildings allowed the Police to form a system of surveillance and control over the Chinatown area that was plagued with crime and vice. Located on Pearl’s Hill, the three-storey building overlooked Chinatown in an era when skyscrapers have yet to be constructed in the area.

                    The unique feature in the Upper Barracks lies in the bomb-proof bunker which served as the nerve centre for police communications during crisis and peacetime. This purpose-built Combined Operations Headquarters had managed major crises that have shaped Singapore through the years. It plugged the gap for effective communications and crisis management. It allowed the Police and armed forces to better coordinate joint responses to incidents. The capabilities of the Combined Operations Headquarters were put to the test shortly after its completion due to the outbreak of the Chinese Middle Schools riots in October 1956. Officers were known to have fielded over 5,000 urgent phone calls during the crisis.
