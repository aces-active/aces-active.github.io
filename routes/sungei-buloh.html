                    Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a world-class eco-tourism experience first discovered in 1986 by a group of birdwatchers from the Malayan Nature Society. Three years after, the site was designated as a nature park by the government in 1989, and officially opened in 1993. In 2003, it was declared as Singapore's first ASEAN heritage park.

                        <li><strong>The Migratory Bird Trail (~1.9km):</strong> A gold mine for avid birdwatchers, and a trail that leads directly to the Aerie tower, which offers panoramic views of Johor Bahru.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Coastal Trail (~1.3km):</strong> An IG-worthy scene! With Eagle Point Boardwalk stretching out onto the Straits of Johor, you can capture yet another impressive view of Johor Bahru. This trail is commonly used for hiking, birdwatching, and capturing insta-worthy shots at the modern pavilion.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Forest Trail (~300m):</strong> For those with less stamina, this trail is an easy one that leads to the Mid-Canopy Walk, where you can cross a netted bridge suspended above the forest floor.</li>

                    Kranji Beach was one of the battle sites in the defence of Northwestern Singapore between the Australian 22nd Brigade and the Japanese Imperial Guards Division. The Australian 22nd Brigade sector included a local unit, Dalforce (made up of a total of 4,000 Chinese volunteers who came from all walks of life), which defended the western bank of the mouth of Sungei Kranji, while the eastern bank of the river was defended by the 2/26 Battalion of the Australian 27th Brigade.

                    On 9 February 1942, the Japanese Imperial Guards Division crossed the Johore Straits and infiltrated the 2/26th position. They encountered stiff resistance which impeded their advancement. Oil from petrol tanks located near Sungei Mandai Kechil was released and set alight. The blazing inferno spilled into the Straits and Kranji coastline, causing further casualties to the invading forces. Panicking at the heavy losses, LG Nishimura, the Commanding Officer of the Guards, wanted to withdraw his troops. However due to an inexplicable decision by the Australian 27th Brigade commander to withdraw his troops from the coast, the Japanese were eventually able to establish a beachhead from Kranji to the Causeway.
