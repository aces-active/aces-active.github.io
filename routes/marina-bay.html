                    The Singapore River lost its traditional importance for trade, setting the scene for the next stage in its development, namely a massive clean-up of the polluted waterway. Completed in 1987, the river was transformed into a clean and pleasant destination lined by historic buildings that have since been repurposed as museums, eateries, hotels and arts facilities. Keeping pace with the nation’s development, the Singapore River continues to symbolise the heartbeat of the nation through its various ebbs and flows.

                    The technological advances that allowed the undertaking of this complex project led founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew came to fruition in 2008 in the form of the Marina Barrage, which is also able to assist in flood control if required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge of obtaining sustainable freshwater supplies has plagued Singapore since the 19th century. The creation of the Marina Barrage has greatly boosted Singapore’s freshwater capacity, adding to our infrastructural resilience, Singapore’s first municipal reservoir and waterworks.

                    The opening of Marina Barrage in 2008 was the fulfilment of a vision decades in the making. Guided by the belief that "every other policy had to bend at the knees for water survival", then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew led efforts to expand local rainwater catchment areas and initiated a decade-long clean-up of the Singapore and Kallang Rivers in 1977. He envisaged the possibility of damming the marina for flood control and creating a reservoir in the city which could also be a beautiful place for everyone to enjoy.

                    Marina Reservoir is now a freshwater reservoir with a catchment area one-sixth the size of Singapore, and a much-loved family attraction. It is a symbol of Singapore’s continuing innovation to overcome our constraints and make this island a better home for all.

                    Comprising three waterfront gardens – Bay South, Bay East and Bay Central – Gardens by the Bay is a key component of Singapore’s journey to becoming a City in a Garden. Since its opening in 2012, it has become a "people’s garden" in the heart of the city.

                    The award-winning Gardens welcomes visitors into diverse botanical worlds, and offers a glimpse into a sustainable future where urban development takes place in harmony with nature. The two conservatories are cooled with energy generated by horticultural waste, and the Supertrees are lit using solar power. Aquatic plants in the lakes filter and cleanse run-off before the water flows into the adjacent Marina Reservoir.
                </p>

                    The Gardens is also the site of the SG50 Future Exhibition and SG50 time capsule, which connects Singapore’s Golden Jubilee celebrations with the future.

                    The Helix Bridge was constructed in 2010, connecting Bayfront to Marina Centre as part of a continuous 3.5-kilometre waterfront promenade around Marina Bay. The waterfront promenade is part of an 11.7-kilometre waterfront route around Marina Reservoir, linking Gardens by the Bay, Marina Barrage and the Singapore Sports Hub.

                    Designed with a unique spiralling steel structure that resembles DNA, the 280-metre long Helix Bridge is a world’s first. The double helix structure symbolises "life and continuity", reflecting Singapore’s aspirations for the Marina Bay area as a bustling business hub where people can live, work and play in an environment nestled among gardens and flanked by water.

                    Completed in 1928, this waterfront building looms large in Singaporeans’ memories as the former General Post Office. It also once housed the Chamber of Commerce, the Singapore Club and various government offices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 1958 to 1978, a lighthouse beacon on the building’s rooftop guided vessels approaching the harbour. The plaza in front of the building, Fullerton Square, was a popular spot for political rallies from the 1950s until the early 1980s.

                <p>
                    In the late 1990s, the building was renovated and adapted as The Fullerton Hotel. Opened in 2001, it commands a spectacular vista of the Civic District as well as Marina Bay, an extension of the Central Business District built on land reclaimed from the sea.

                    This area by the mouth of the Singapore River offered a commanding view of the straits and was the site of the office of the Master Attendant, the harbour’s most senior official, in the late 19th century.

                <p>
                    Built in 1949, The Fullerton Waterboat House once housed the offices of Hammer & Company, then a key supplier of fresh water to visiting ships in the Singapore harbour. The building was later taken over by the Port of Singapore Authority, served as its office and continued the provision of the vital port service until 1990.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The building was conserved in 2002 as part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s efforts to retain Singapore’s historic waterfront at Collyer Quay. Its ship-like Art Deco features now stand as a striking reminder of Singapore’s maritime legacy.

                    The Merlion, with its lion head, symbolises Singapore as a "Lion City" so named by Sang Nila Utama, a Sumatran prince, who according to legend, spotted a lion upon landing on this island at the turn of the 14th century. The Merlion’s fish-like body is a reference to the other ancient name of Singapore, "Temasek", which means "Sea Town" in Javanese. This 8.6-metre tall, 70-tonne statue, which blends Singapore’s ancient past with its maritime progress, was designed by artist and educator Kwan Sai Kheong and carved by craftsman Lim Nang Seng.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Merlion was originally sited at the mouth of the Singapore River in 1972. In 2002, after the construction of the Esplanade Bridge, the Merlion was moved to its current position at the Merlion Park to retain the unobstructed waterfront views of the statue.

                    Opened by Singapore’s third Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as part of Singapore’s Golden Jubilee Celebrations, this bridge was a suggestion by Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to provide a friendly, barrier free connection between the Merlion Park and the waterfront promenade in front of the Esplanade.

                    The 220-metre bridge offers a panoramic vista of the historic Civic District to the east and of the Central Business District and Marina Bay to the west. Marina Bay is the result of the foresight of Singapore’s planners, who had initiated land reclamation at Marina South and Marina Centre in 1971 to create a substantial land bank for the future growth of the city centre. The reclaimed land formed an inland bay that provided a new focal point for the city and a stage for national celebrations.

                    This green expanse, which once directly fronted the sea before land reclamation formed Esplanade Park, has been the site of many momentous events in Singapore’s history. The Padang (Malay for "field") was where the people of Singapore gathered to mark the end of the Japanese Occupation on 12 September 1945, and to witness the installation of Yusof bin Ishak as Singapore’s first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State) and the unveiling of the State Flag, State Crest and National Anthem on 3 December 1959.

                    The completion of Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay in 2002 was the fruition of the idea for a performing arts centre, first mooted in the 1970s, to nurture a creative and culturally vibrant society. Located on the site of a popular hawker centre called the Satay Club, the Esplanade provoked much debate, particularly for its spiky roof domes which were designed to provide shade while allowing views of the city from the inside.

                    The Esplanade has since become a well-loved icon on the Marina Bay waterfront, known affectionately to Singaporeans as the "Durians", after the local spiky fruit. Built for the people of Singapore as a cornerstone of the performing arts ecosystem, it serves as Singapore’s premier home for the performing arts, with programmes and community festivals catering to diverse audiences.
