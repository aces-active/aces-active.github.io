                    The Singapore Railway Line was the southernmost segment in the West Coast Line of the Malayan railway system. It was mooted as early as the 1860s, approved by the Legislative Council in 1899 and completed in 1903 at a cost of $2 million.

                    When the railway line was constructed over a century ago, by linking the heart of tiny Singapore to the vast continent of Eurasia it certainly symbolized Connectivity and Progress. Over the years it has acquired a rich patina of history not only as an important transport link but in the collective memory of people who have travelled to and from Singapore out of necessity or in search of adventure, romance or discovery.

                    In recent decades the railway line has come to be viewed as politically divisive and a thorny barrier to efficient land use planning. Simultaneously however, it still serves its function of connecting people and places and because it is one of the rare places on the island left untouched by development it has evolved its own intricate network of micro-ecosystems.

                    Bukit Timah Railway Station acted as a freight interchange until the early nineties. From 1993 to 2011, trains have sped by without stopping though there were still daily exchanges of tokens between the trains and the station masters. The tokens serve as proofs of authority that the trains are on the right tracks and are allowed to continue from Bukit Timah.
