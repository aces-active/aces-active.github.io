                    Also known as Opium Hill, this site saw intense fighting on 14 February 1942, during the Battle of Singapore. Led by Lieutenant Adnan Saidi, men of the "C" Company of the 1st Malay Brigade held their ground despite being heavily outnumbered, and fought to their deaths. The only Malay Regiment surviving witness was Corporal Yaako, who pretended to be dead so the Japanese soldiers wouldn’t kill him. For his bravery, Lieutenant Adnan Saidi was recognised posthumously by the British government and his heroic contingent is remembered for their sacrifices while defending Singapore.

                    The Ford Motor Company which was first established in Singapore at Anson Road in 1926, moved to its new state-of-the-art factory located at Upper Bukit Timah Road in October 1941. The Art Deco factory became Ford’s first motorcar assembly plant in Southeast Asia. The factory was later taken over by the Royal Air Force during the Malayan Campaign (8 December 1941 – 31 January 1942) where it was used to assemble fighter planes. However, the planes were hastily moved away from Singapore towards the end of January 1942, when it became clear that victory was unlikely.

                    On 13 February 1942, the factory was seized by Japanese forces and turned into the temporary headquarters of Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the Japanese Commander of the 25th Army. Two days later on 15 February 1942, Lieutenant-General A. E. Percival, the British General Officer Commanding (Malaya), met Lieutenant-General Yamashita in the Boardroom of the Ford Factory, where the British surrendered unconditionally to the Japanese, effectively sealing the fate of Singapore for the next three and a half years.
