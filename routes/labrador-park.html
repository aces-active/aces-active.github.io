                    From as early as the 13th century, the waterway in Keppel Bay had been used as a passage for ships sailing from the Straits of Malacca to the South China Sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In September 1819, William Farquhar, whom Sir Stamford Raffles appointed as the first Resident of Singapore, reported that he discovered a "new harbour" to the west of the settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1848, Captain Henry Keppel discovered the sheltered, deep water harbour onboard the vessel, Meander. Reparis on the Meander were the first carried out in the harbour, known as New Harbour, where the Tanjong Pagar wharves would later be built. That name remained until 1900, when Keppel, then Admiral, visited Singapore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To honour him, the acting Governor, Sir Alexander Swettenham, renamed the harbour <span style="font-family: Roboto Mono; color: #AA2D07; font-weight: 500;">Keppel Harbour</span>.

                    Within Keppel Bay are some of Singapore's oldest docks. The island's first graving doc, Dock No. 1, as it was known, was built in 1859. Eight years later, Dock No. 2 was constructed, which is today one of the water channels purposefully incorporated into the architecture of Caribbean at Keppel Bay.

                    Under the modernisation programme for the port in the early 1900s, the 40,000 dwt. King's Dock, then the second largest in the world, was opened on 26 August 1913. The 30,000 dwt. Queen's Dock was opened in 1956 and is today the water channel which lies between Caribbean at Keppel Bay and Reflections at Keppel Bay.
