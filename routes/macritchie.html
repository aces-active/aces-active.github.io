                    Completed in the late 1860s, MacRitchie Reservoir, situated off Lornie Road, was the first water supply system in Singapore. The Impounding Reservoir or Thomson Road Reservoir, as it was originally called, was renamed MacRitchie Reservoir in 1922 after James MacRitchie, the municipal engineer of Singapore from 1883 to 1895.

                    Opened on 4 August 1967, MacRitchie Reservoir Park has since become a popular spot for joggers and strollers. The park features a bandstand built over the water, and connected to the shore by a zigzag walkway and a floating fountain. Students were allowed to canoe at MacRitchie in 1978, and a boathouse was completed in 1979.

                    In 2000, sport fishing was allowed at a designated area on the eastern end of the reservoir near the Lornie–Thomson Road junction. The annual National Inter-School Cross Country Championships were held there from 1960 to 2002. An extensive makeover from 2008 to 2011 under the Public Utilities Board’s Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) programme saw the addition of a two-storey carpark and toilets with shower facilities.

                    In the 1930s, Lim, under the alias Tan Choon Lim, participated in anti-Japanese activities in Singapore. Upon the request of the then governor of Singapore, Shenton Thomas, Lim formed the Chinese Liaison Committee to assist in civil defence. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the fall of Kota Bharu in northern Malaya in December 1941, Lim organised more than 10,000 men for the British government to man essential services and to construct defences around the island. As Japanese troops began to approach Singapore from Johor, Lim and his team helped to blow up the Causeway to impede the Japanese advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before Singapore fell to the Japanese, Lim escaped to India where he was joined by the British resistance group, Force 136, and was trained by the British for intelligence work. Force 136 was a special operations force formed by the British and Chinese governments in June 1942 to support resistance groups behind enemy lines and to coordinate guerrilla operations in support of the planned British invasion of Malaya. In 1943, Lim went to China to recruit men for Force 136. With a group of fellow Force 136 members, he landed in Japanese-occupied Malaya by submarine later that year, and set up an intelligence network in the urban areas of Pangkor, Lumut, Tapah and Ipoh. The intelligence network, known as Operation Zipper, was aimed at recapturing Malaya with British support by 1945.

                    While in Ipoh, Lim’s whereabouts and espionage involvement were betrayed to the Japanese. On 27 March 1944, he was caught by the Japanese while fleeing. Lim died in Batu Gajah Jail, Perak, on 29 June 1944. After the war, Lim’s remains were disinterred from the jail in December 1945 and reburied in Singapore on 13 January 1946, on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir. In February 1946, the Chinese Nationalist government posthumously awarded him the rank of major-general.

                    When Singapore fell to the Japanese forces in 1942, then-commander of Japan’s Fifth Division’s Engineers Regiment, Major Tamura, commissioned the construction of a Shinto shrine to honour the Japanese soldiers who had lost their lives during battle. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shrine was built near Sime Road, at the western part of the MacRitchie reservoir, along with the Syonan Chureito – a memorial built on top of Bukit Batok Hill honouring the Japanese war dead. These were the two sacred sites built by the victorious Japanese when they conquered Singapore. The highly ambitious Major Tamura envisioned it being the greatest Japanese monument in the whole of the South, second only to the iconic Meiji Jingu in Tokyo.

                    On 7 May 1942, the foundation stone of the shrine was laid by Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who led the 25th Army and successfully captured Singapore and Malaya. Another ceremony was held on 30 July to mark the completion of the shrine’s framework as well as the opening of the Divine Bridge that would provide access to the shrine.

                    The shrine would subsequently be the hub of many religious ceremonies and rituals. Worshippers consisting of Japanese soldiers, military leaders, and a small portion of Singaporeans who were forced to attend in order to show allegiance would cross the Divine Bridge and ascend a series of steps to the top of the hill where the shrine resided. The shrine was modelled after the Ise Grand Shrine in Japan, and dedicated to the Sun Goddess Amaterasu Omikami, whom the Japanese emperor was said to be a direct descendant of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To impress upon the conquered local population the importance of loyalty to Japanese imperial ideals, the military declared Amaterasu to be the “Eternal Protector of Malaya and Sumatra who is to be worshipped by the local inhabitants”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just before the Japanese surrendered, they burnt the shrine to the ground for fear of its desecration by returning British forces. The destruction of the shrine by fire was considered an acceptable practice as part of the purification rites in the Shinto religion. Today, the visible remnants of the shrine include the granite receptacle-cum-fountain, stone steps, and the stone foundation of the wooden bridge leading to the shrine.
