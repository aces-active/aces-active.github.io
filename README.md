### Historic Docks

<img src="https://www.sqfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sph-Caribbean-Keppel-Bay-condo.jpg" width="100%">

Within Keppel Bay are some of Singapore's oldest docks. The island's first graving doc, Dock No. 1, as it was known, was built in 1859. Eight years later, Dock No. 2 was constructed, which is today one of the water channels purposefully incorporated into the architecture of Caribbean at Keppel Bay.

Under the modernisation programme for the port in the early 1900s, the 40,000 dwt. King's Dock, then the second largest in the world, was opened on 26 August 1913. The 30,000 dwt. Queen's Dock was opened in 1956 and is today the water channel which lies between Caribbean at Keppel Bay and Reflections at Keppel Bay.
